/**
 * <p>
 * A {@link Group} that represents an AminoAcid.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In PDB files information on AminoAcids can be observed in the SEQRES and in the ATOM records.
 * Since frequently coordinates for some of the amino acids are missing, during parsing of the PDB
 * files the SEQRES and the ATOM records are aligned and a whenever possible the AminoAcid objects 
 * are combined. Access to the SEQRES and ATOM sequence is possible through the {@link Chain} object.
 * It is possible to distinguish between SEQRES and ATOM derived AminoAcids by {@link #getRecordType()}.
 * </p>
 * 
 *<p>
 *  AminoAcid inherits most from {@link HetatomImpl }.  Adds a few AminoAcid
 *  specific methods.
